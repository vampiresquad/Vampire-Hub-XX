## ‚ú® Features

Vampire-Hub-X comes packed with an intuitive, colorful, and menu-driven interface, ensuring a seamless experience.

* **Multi-Mode Access:**
    * **Normal User Mode:** Provides limited access to core features, perfect for general reconnaissance.
    * **Hidden Admin Mode:** Unlocks advanced, high-powerful functionalities. Accessible via a secure password.

* **Robust Information Gathering:**
    * **Whois Lookup:** Retrieve domain registration details.
    * **DNS Lookup:** Query A, MX, NS records for comprehensive domain information.
    * **IP Geolocation:** Pinpoint the geographical location of IP addresses or domains.
    * **Port Scanning (Nmap Integration):** Conduct thorough port scans using Nmap for identifying open ports and services.
    * **Subdomain Enumeration:** Discover hidden subdomains associated with a target.

* **DDoS Attack Simulation (Ethical Use Only):**
    * **SYN Flood:** Simulate SYN floods (for authorized stress testing environments).
    * **HTTP Flood:** Perform HTTP request floods to test web server resilience.
    * **UDP Flood (Under Development):** Future support for UDP-based attacks.

* **Enhanced User Experience:**
    * **Colorful & Advanced UI:** Utilizes `rich` and `colorama` for a beautiful, responsive terminal interface.
    * **Slow Writing Effect:** Engaging text display for banners and disclaimers.
    * **Hidden Password Input:** Ensures secure entry of sensitive credentials (Master & Admin passwords).

* **Reliability & Stability:**
    * **Automatic Dependency Installation:** Automatically checks and installs required Python libraries from `requirements.txt`.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Follow these simple steps to get Vampire-Hub-X up and running on your system.

**Prerequisites:**

* **Python 3.x:** Ensure Python 3 and `pip` are installed and in your system's PATH.
* **Git:** Required to clone the repository.
* **Nmap:** Essential for the Port Scanning feature.
    * **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap git -y`
    * **Linux (Fedora/CentOS):** `sudo dnf install nmap git -y`
    * **macOS (with Homebrew):** `brew install nmap git`
    * **Windows:** Download installer from [nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html). Ensure "Add to PATH" is selected during installation.

**Installation Steps (Linux/macOS recommended):**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Navigate to the directory where you want to save the tool, then run:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vampiresquad/Vampire-Hub-XX.git](https://github.com/vampiresquad/Vampire-Hub-XX.git)
    cd Vampire-Hub-XX
    ```

2.  **Make `install.sh` Executable & Run:**
    The `install.sh` script automates dependency installation and setup.
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    ```
    * **Note:** The script may ask for your `sudo` password to install system packages like `git` and `nmap`.

    **For Windows Users:**
    Currently, there is no direct `install.bat` provided. You will need to:
    * Manually install Python 3.x, Git, and Nmap (ensure they are added to PATH).
    * Open PowerShell/CMD in the cloned `Vampire-Hub-XX` directory.
    * Create and activate a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv` then `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    * Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run

After successful installation:

1.  **Navigate to the Tool Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Vampire-Hub-XX
    ```

2.  **Activate Virtual Environment (if not already active):**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows PowerShell
    ```

3.  **Run the Tool:**
    ```bash
    python Vampire_Hub_X.py
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter the **Master Password**: `VampireX`
    For **Admin Mode**, the password is: `SH404`

## üì¶ Building an Executable (Advanced)

For easier distribution, you can create a standalone executable using `PyInstaller`.
(Note: You will need to temporarily comment out `check_and_install_dependencies()` in `Vampire_Hub_X.py` before building, as PyInstaller bundles all dependencies.)

1.  **Install PyInstaller:**
    ```bash
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the main tool directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Vampire-Hub-XX
    ```
3.  **Build the executable:**
    ```bash
    pyinstaller Vampire_Hub_X.py --onefile --name Vampire-Hub-X-Secure
    ```
    The executable will be generated in the `dist/` directory.
